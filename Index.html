  <p>I am a Spanish Instructor for Kansas City Kansas Community College and
    Metropolitan Community College, in the Kansas City Metro area.
    Additionally, for the past two years I have worked as a TESOL/ESL
    Instructor for the Independence School District. Prior to that, I worked as
    a graduate teaching assistant, and later instructor, at the University of
    Missouri-Kansas City. For nearly a decade I have worked with, and guided,
    high school, college, and adult learners in their desire to learn a new
    language. I hope to use this experience as a catapult for my endeavors in
    the Instructional Design and Technology field.</p>
